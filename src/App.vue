            A debt of gratitude is owed to Mr. Fumitaka Anzai for his<br />
            "Poly Music" stack, which was liberally employed as an aid in the
            creation of these tiny versions of our songs. We also used two of
            the samples in his stack.

            If the music on this program sounds too messed up, it may be that
            it's playing incorrectly (though perhaps not). If this is the case,
            allocating more memory to Hypercard (in the bottom right corner of
            Hypercard's "Get Info" window) may improve the situation.
